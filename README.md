# Verilog Counter Design | VLSI Project

This repository contains the Verilog code and testbench for a simple digital counter, designed as part of my learning in VLSI and digital system design.

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a [**3-bit**] synchronous counter using Verilog HDL. It can be used as a basic building block in digital systems for tasks such as timing, counting events, or frequency division.

The design includes:
- A counter module with reset and clock
- Optional enable and load features (if implemented)
- A testbench to simulate and verify functionality

## 🛠️ Features

- Synchronous design
- Supports **reset** (synchronous or asynchronous)
- Testbench for functional verification
